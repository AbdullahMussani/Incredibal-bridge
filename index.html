            <h2> <b>About </b></h2>
            <p> The simplest and earliest types of bridges were stepping stones. Neolithic people also built a form of
                boardwalk across marshes; examples of such bridges include the Sweet Track and the Post Track in
                England, approximately 6000 years old.[3] Undoubtedly, ancient people would also have used log bridges;
                that is a timber bridge[4] that fall naturally or are intentionally felled or placed across streams.
                Some of the first man-made bridges with significant span were probably intentionally felled trees.[5]

                        <p>Also known as the Allāhverdi Khan Bridge, Iran’s Si-o-se Pol (which translates as ‘Bridge of

                            connecting its historical main avenue Chahar Bagh with the neighborhood of New Jolfa.
                            Commissioned by Shah Abbas I of Persia, Si-o-se Pol is almost 300 meters long and 14 meters
                            wide and is considered one of the world’s finest examples of Safavid dynasty era bridge
                            design. Alongside the equally impressive, but slightly younger Pol-e Khaju built in 1650 and
                            the ancient Pol-e Shahrestan, dating back as far as the 3rd century, Si-o-se Pol is one of

                            of construction – is one of the city’s, if not the entire West Coast’s, most iconic
                            architectural feats. Its famous color, often mistaken for red but actually ‘International
                            Orange’, was chosen for its ability to complement its existing environment and remain
                            visible in the Bay Area’s legendary fog. The building of the Golden Gate Bridge made major
                            contributions to construction safety with Strauss insisting on the installation of a safety
                            net, amusingly dubbed the ‘Halfway-to-Hell Club’ by workers.

                            architectural practice WilkinsonEyre and structural engineering firm Gifford.The bridge
                            is sometimes called the 'Blinking Eye Bridge'or the 'Winking Eye Bridge' due to its

                            overpass in Tehran, Iran. The 270-metre (890 ft) bridge connects two public parks —
                            Taleghani Park and Abo-Atash Park — by spanning Modarres Expressway, one of the main
                            highways in northern Tehran. The word tabiat means "nature" in the Persian language.

                            The bridge was designed by Diba Tensile Architecture (Leila Araghian and Alireza
                            Behzadi). It has won several awards, including the Popular Choice Prize for Highways &

                            between 1886 and 1894, designed by Horace Jones and engineered by John Wolfe Barry with the
                            help of Henry Marc Brunel.[1] It crosses the River Thames close to the Tower of London and
                            is one of five London bridges owned and maintained by the Bridge House Estates, a charitable
                            trust founded in 1282. The bridge was constructed to give better access to the East End of
                            London, which had expanded its commercial potential in the 19th century. The bridge was
                            opened by Edward, Prince of Wales and Alexandra, Princess of Wales in 1894.

                        <p>A truss bridge is a bridge whose load-bearing superstructure is composed of a truss, a
                            structure of connected elements, usually forming triangular units. The connected elements
                            (typically straight) may be stressed from tension, compression, or sometimes both in
                            response to dynamic loads. The basic types of truss bridges shown in this article have
                            simple designs which could be easily analyzed by 19th and early 20th-century engineers. A
                            truss bridge is economical to construct because it uses materials efficiently.

                        <p>An arch bridge is a bridge with abutments at each end shaped as a curved arch. Arch bridges
                            work by transferring the weight of the bridge and its loads partially into a horizontal
                            thrust restrained by the abutments at either side. A viaduct (a long bridge) may be made
                            from a series of arches, although other more economical structures are typically used today.

                        <p>Beam bridges are the simplest structural forms for bridge spans supported by an abutment or
                            pier at each end. No moments are transferred throughout the support, hence their
                            structural type is known as simply supported.
                            The simplest beam bridge could be a log (see log bridge), a wood plank, or a stone slab (see
                            clapper bridge) laid across a stream. Bridges designed for modern infrastructure will
                            usually be constructed of steel or reinforced concrete, or a combination of both. The
                            concrete elements may be reinforced, prestressed or post-tensioned. Such modern bridges
                            include girder, plate girder, and box girder bridges, all types of beam bridges.

                                    The bridge is a structure that provides passage over obstacles such as valleys,
                                    rough terrain, or bodies of water by spanning those obstacles with natural or
                                    human-made materials. They began being constructed in ancient times when modern
                                    civilizations started rising in Mesopotamia. From then on, knowledge, engineering,
                                    and manufacturing of new bridge-building materials spread beyond their borders,
                                    enabling bridges' slow but steady adoption worldwide.
