            <h2> <b>About </b></h2>
            <p> The simplest and earliest types of bridges were stepping stones. Neolithic people also built a form of
                boardwalk across marshes; examples of such bridges include the Sweet Track and the Post Track in
                England, approximately 6000 years old.[3] Undoubtedly, ancient people would also have used log bridges;
                that is a timber bridge[4] that fall naturally or are intentionally felled or placed across streams.
                Some of the first man-made bridges with significant span were probably intentionally felled trees.[5]

                            East
                            River, the Brooklyn Bridge was officially opened in May <br> 1883 and laid claim to the
                            title of
                            ‘world’s longest suspension bridge’ until it was pipped to the post by the nearby
                            Williamsburg
                            Bridge in 1903, which surpassed its length by two meters. Nevertheless, the Brooklyn Bridge
                            is
                            one of the most iconic architectural features of New York City’s stunning skyline and has

                        <img src="images/History/historic/2053841 (1).webp" alt="">
                        <p>Also known as the Allāhverdi Khan Bridge, Iran’s Si-o-se Pol (which translates as ‘Bridge of
                            33 Arches’) dates back to 1602 and stretches across the Zayandeh Rood River in Isfahan,
                            connecting its historical main avenue Chahar Bagh with the neighborhood of New Jolfa.
                            Commissioned by Shah Abbas I of Persia, Si-o-se Pol is almost 300 meters long and 14 meters
                            wide and is considered one of the world’s finest examples of Safavid dynasty era bridge
                            design. Alongside the equally impressive, but slightly younger Pol-e Khaju built in 1650 and
                            the ancient Pol-e Shahrestan, dating back as far as the 3rd century, Si-o-se Pol is one of
                            11 bridges in Isfahan.

                        <p>San Francisco’s magnificent Golden Gate Bridge – designed by American civil engineer Joseph
                            Baermann Strauss in a grand Art Deco style and officially opened in 1937 after seven years
                            of construction – is one of the city’s, if not the entire West Coast’s, most iconic
                            architectural feats. Its famous color, often mistaken for red but actually ‘International
                            Orange’, was chosen for its ability to complement its existing environment and remain
                            visible in the Bay Area’s legendary fog. The building of the Golden Gate Bridge made major
                            contributions to construction safety with Strauss insisting on the installation of a safety
                            net, amusingly dubbed the ‘Halfway-to-Hell Club’ by workers.

                            area on the north bank. It was the first tilting bridge ever to be constructed. Opened
                            for public use in 2001, the award-winning structure was conceived and designed by
                            architectural practice WilkinsonEyre and structural engineering firm Gifford.The bridge
                            is sometimes called the 'Blinking Eye Bridge'or the 'Winking Eye Bridge' due to its
                            shape and its tilting method. The Millennium Bridge stands as the twentieth tallest

                        <p>The Tabi'at Bridge (Persian: پل طبیعت, lit.'The bridge of nature') is the largest pedestrian
                            overpass in Tehran, Iran. The 270-metre (890 ft) bridge connects two public parks —
                            Taleghani Park and Abo-Atash Park — by spanning Modarres Expressway, one of the main
                            highways in northern Tehran. The word tabiat means "nature" in the Persian language.

                            The bridge was designed by Diba Tensile Architecture (Leila Araghian and Alireza
                            Behzadi). It has won several awards, including the Popular Choice Prize for Highways &

                            between 1886 and 1894, designed by Horace Jones and engineered by John Wolfe Barry with the
                            help of Henry Marc Brunel.[1] It crosses the River Thames close to the Tower of London and
                            is one of five London bridges owned and maintained by the Bridge House Estates, a charitable
                            trust founded in 1282. The bridge was constructed to give better access to the East End of
                            London, which had expanded its commercial potential in the 19th century. The bridge was
                            opened by Edward, Prince of Wales and Alexandra, Princess of Wales in 1894.

                        <p>A truss bridge is a bridge whose load-bearing superstructure is composed of a truss, a
                            structure of connected elements, usually forming triangular units. The connected elements
                            (typically straight) may be stressed from tension, compression, or sometimes both in
                            response to dynamic loads. The basic types of truss bridges shown in this article have
                            simple designs which could be easily analyzed by 19th and early 20th-century engineers. A
                            truss bridge is economical to construct because it uses materials efficiently.

                        <p>An arch bridge is a bridge with abutments at each end shaped as a curved arch. Arch bridges
                            work by transferring the weight of the bridge and its loads partially into a horizontal
                            thrust restrained by the abutments at either side. A viaduct (a long bridge) may be made
                            from a series of arches, although other more economical structures are typically used today.

                        <p>Beam bridges are the simplest structural forms for bridge spans supported by an abutment or
                            pier at each end. No moments are transferred throughout the support, hence their
                            structural type is known as simply supported.
                            The simplest beam bridge could be a log (see log bridge), a wood plank, or a stone slab (see
                            clapper bridge) laid across a stream. Bridges designed for modern infrastructure will
                            usually be constructed of steel or reinforced concrete, or a combination of both. The
                            concrete elements may be reinforced, prestressed or post-tensioned. Such modern bridges
                            include girder, plate girder, and box girder bridges, all types of beam bridges.

                            62 BC, it spans half of the Tiber River, from the Campus Martius on the east side to Tiber
                            Island in the middle (the Pons Cestius is west of the island). Quattro Capi ("four heads")
                            refers to the two marble pillars of the two-faced Janus herms on the parapet, which were

                        <p>The Arkadiko Bridge or Kazarma Bridge is a Mycenaean bridge near the modern road from Tiryns
                            to Epidauros in Argolis on the Peloponnese, Greece. The stone crossing, which is dated to
                            the Greek Bronze Age, is one of the oldest arch bridges still in existence which is still
                            crossable today. It is the oldest preserved bridge in Europe.
